// Simple and support n sized arrays
// This isn't very space optimized since it stores redundant info, ex: [x, y, z] over and over again rather than [x, [y, z]]
// More human readable due to this tho, which is better for my needs

// I'ma just make it strictly 2 dimensions for now just to test the concept

// This is basically a tensor

3 // dimensions
[1, 2, 3] // x, y, z
